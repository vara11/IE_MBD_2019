# IE_MBD_2019
 This repository contains projects carried out during my master's in big data and business analytics program while at IE university.

## Data competitions:
Python and R codes for Kaggle and other Data Science Competitions.
1) House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques: This is a competition on Kaggle whereby the objective is to predict the prices of houses. It was done as part of our Machine Learning II coursework using R. This was an individual project and a final result of 0.12768 was achieved.
2) Pump it Up: This is a Driven-Data competition done using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water where the objective is to predict which water pumps are functional or need repairs. It was done as a group assignment as part of our Machine Learning II coursework using Python. The final result achieved was a classification rate of 0.8171 (top 10%).

## Data Model (MySQL):
Two data models (star-schema) were created as part of our SQL and Data warehousing courses using MySQL workbench. These models were:
1) A data model designed for a luxury cruise company.
2) A data model designed to analyse a social media marketing program (used in ETL and Tableau dashboard).

## Data Visualisation:
1) Tableau dashboard that was based on a database created in MySQL after an ETL was done using Pentaho.
2) D3 visualisation assignment of a dataset detailing bike crimes in London.
3) An R markdown that uses various plot and charts to showcase the expenses of a particular individual and the html created after running the markdown.
4) A interactive map visualisation using Carto of crimes committed in Chicago.

## Hadoop:
The file includes queries written on Hive to extract and analyse data from tweets (using Twitter API).

## IBM Watson Chatbot Challenge:
Using IBM Watson, we developed a chatbot around a Children's Education company in Colombia. The folder contains the presentation.

## Machine Learning I Assignments:
1) Clustering: A report on a clustering project carried out in Dataiku.
2) Linear Regression: A report on a linear regression project carried out in Dataiku.

## Microsoft Vision Challenge:
A presentation and video that shows how computer vision could be used to build a fruit delivery business. Azure was used as the technology provider.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP):
As part of our coursework, in groups of 2, we had to implement NLP techniques and methodologies to classify fake or real news on a dataset.

## Pentaho (ETL):
Contains Pentaho files and the ETL flow for the social media marketing program.

## Python Programming:
A series of Python jupyter notebooks as part of our coursework that contain:
1) Solutions for the first 10 Euler problems.
2) Exploratory data analysis on the Titanic Dataset.

## R Programming:
A series of R codes that were used to predict solar production on a Kaggle dataset. In addition to this, we had to create a R-Markdown and Shiny app to showcase our results.

## Spark:
This includes an individual assignment as part of our coursework where we had to solve some predefined questions using Pycharm SQL and the DataFrame API.

## SQL:
The files contain SQL queries that were written to extract data for a Luxury_Cruise company and answer some pre-defined questions.
